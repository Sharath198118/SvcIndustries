SVC Industries: Pioneering Sustainable Tyre Recycling

At SVC Industries, we are committed to creating a cleaner, more sustainable future by transforming old tyres into valuable resources. Our innovative recycling process uses advanced technology to heat tyres in a controlled reactor, breaking them down into oil, carbon, and steel. This not only reduces waste but also provides high-quality byproducts that are essential for various industries.
